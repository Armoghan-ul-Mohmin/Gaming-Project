## Getting Started

To get started with the development of the online gaming platform, follow the steps below.

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/online-gaming-platform.git
```

2. Set up the required dependencies and tools as specified in the [Technologies Used](../README.md#technologies-used) section of the README.md file.

## Architecture Overview

The online gaming platform follows a client-server architecture, where the client is responsible for rendering the user interface and handling user interactions, while the server manages the business logic and data storage.

The client-side of the application is built using HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), and JavaScript. The server-side utilizes PHP for handling requests, connecting to the database, and processing data.

## Directory Structure

The directory structure of the project is organized as follows:

- `css`: Contains CSS files for styling the application.
- `js`: Contains JavaScript files for client-side functionality.
- `includes`: Contains PHP files with reusable functions and configurations.
- `database`: Contains the SQL file for creating the necessary database tables.
- `docs`: Contains the user guide and developer guide documentation files.
- `images`: Contains images used in the application.
- `index.php`: The main entry point of the application.

For a more detailed breakdown of the directory structure, please refer to the project's README.md file.

## Database Schema

The online gaming platform uses a MySQL database to store user information, game lobbies, chat messages, and other relevant data. The database schema is defined in the `database/database.sql` file.

Please refer to the database schema file for the table definitions and their relationships.

## Server-side Development

The server-side of the online gaming platform is built using PHP. The server-side code can be found in the following files and directories:

- `index.php`: Handles the routing and serves as the entry point for the application.
- `includes/`: Contains PHP files with reusable functions and configurations.

To modify or extend the server-side functionality, you can make changes to the relevant PHP files according to your requirements.

## Client-side Development

The client-side of the online gaming platform is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The client-side code can be found in the following files and directories:

- `index.php`: Contains the HTML structure of the application.
- `css/`: Contains CSS files for styling the application.
- `js/`: Contains JavaScript files for client-side functionality.

To modify or extend the client-side functionality, you can make changes to the relevant HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files according to your requirements.

## Testing

The online gaming platform can be tested by following these steps:

1. Set up the project as described in the [Getting Started](#getting-started) section.
2. Configure a local web server with PHP support.
3. Access the application in a web browser and test its features and functionality.

You can also write automated tests using frameworks like PHPUnit for testing the server-side code, and frameworks like Jasmine or Jest for testing the client-side JavaScript code.

## Deployment

To deploy the online gaming platform to a production environment, follow these steps:

1. Set up a web server with PHP and MySQL support.
2. Configure the web server to point to the project's directory.
3. Import the database schema into your MySQL database.
4. Update the database configuration in `includes/database.php` with your database credentials.
5. Access the deployed application using the appropriate URL.

Make sure to secure the deployment environment and follow best practices for web application security.
